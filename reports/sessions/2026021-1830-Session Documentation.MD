## 1. Executive Summary

The Sentinel-Ops project has stabilized its primary Proxmox footprint. We have successfully deployed **VM-106** (2GB RAM) using Terraform, implemented a "Zero Trust" credential model, and established a GitHub-based VCS. The project is now moving toward a **Multi-Service Architecture** utilizing Kubernetes, Distributed Storage, and Local AI.

---

## 2. Completed Technical Work

* **IaC Provisioning**: Automated creation of VM-106 via Terraform.
* **Resource Tuning**: Verified 16GB Host RAM stability and 7.8GB Swap safety net.
* **VCS Clean-up**: Scrubbed exposed Personal Access Tokens from Git history.
* **CI/CD Foundation**: Pushed GitHub Actions workflow for automated `terraform plan`.

---

## 3. Security & Identity Audit

* **Credential Handling**: Moved all API keys to `secret.tfvars` and GitHub Secrets.
* **Git Compliance**: `.gitignore` updated to prevent future credential leaks.
* **Token Scopes**: Updated GitHub PAT with `workflow` scope for Action management.

## 4. Phase 3 Roadmap: The Private AI Cloud

This phase transforms your lab from "infrastructure" to a "platform" capable of running private AI and distributed messaging.

| Component | Purpose | Technology |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Orchestration** | Container Management | **K3s** (Lightweight K8s) |
| **Deployment** | Package Management | **Helm** (The K8s App Store) |
| **Storage** | Persistent AI Models | **Longhorn** (Distributed Storage) |
| **Messaging** | System Communication | **RabbitMQ** (Message Broker) |
| **Private AI** | Local LLM Hosting | **Ollama** (Llama 3 / Mistral) |
| **PoC** | Cluster Verification | **Hello World** (Nginx/Lightweight) |

---

## 5. Implementation Strategy: Helm & Kubernetes

### **Step 1: The Foundation (K3s & Helm)**

We will install a lightweight Kubernetes cluster (**K3s**) directly on your Ubuntu VM.

* **Helm** will be our primary tool for installing complex software like RabbitMQ and Longhorn with a single command.

### **Step 2: Persistent Storage (Longhorn)**

Since AI models (Ollama) are large and RabbitMQ data must survive restarts, we will deploy **Longhorn**.

* **Note**: This requires `open-iscsi` and `nfs-common` on your Ubuntu host.

### **Step 3: The AI Brain (Ollama)**

Deploying Ollama via Helm allows you to run models like **Llama 3** locally.

* **Next Step**: Configuring GPU Passthrough in Proxmox to give Ollama raw power.

## 6. Action Items for Next Session

1. **GitHub Runner**: Set up the Self-Hosted Runner on `andy@ubuntu24`.
2. **K3s Installation**: Deploy the lightweight Kubernetes engine.
3. **Helm Setup**: Install the Helm binary and add the official repositories for Bitnami (RabbitMQ) and Longhorn.
4. **The "Hello World" Test**: Deploy your first container to verify the network.

**Report generated by Gemini 3 Flash**.

**Would you like me to prepare the specific shell commands for the K3s and Helm installation so you can run them when you get back?**
