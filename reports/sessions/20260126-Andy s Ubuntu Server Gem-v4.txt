Kubeconfig Portability: Keep a copy of your kubeconfig on your OOBM device (Raspberry Pi) so you can run kubectl commands against the Sentinel node even if your primary workstation is offline.

🗺️ Updated Prioritized Roadmap (Jan 26, 2026)
This roadmap now integrates OOBM into the very beginning of your setup to ensure you never lose access during the hardening phases.

Priority	Phase	Goal
1	Git Config Management	
Version control for Netplan, RKE2, and OOBM scripts.

2	24GB RAM Upgrade	
Finalize hardware allocation via Proxmox host.

3	OS & SSH Hardening	Secure the Ubuntu 24.04 base and OOBM access points.

4	Raspberry Pi OOBM	Set up the Pi as an external observer with Prometheus/Grafana.

5	ZTA Demo & Storage	
Deploy "Hello World" with Longhorn and Zero Trust NetworkPolicies.

6	Ollama & RabbitMQ	
Deploy AI core and messaging with mTLS and scoped access.

7	Kata Containers	
Apply final kernel-level hardware isolation.

📑 Final Status Summary (Pre-Shutdown)

Sentinel Node: Anchored at 192.168.1.50.

Current State: Database is clean; RKE2 is ready for stabilization.

OOBM Plan: Raspberry Pi will act as the "Secondary Eye" to monitor the 24GB node.

Your environment is now safe to shut down . 1. Run sudo systemctl stop rke2-server inside the VM. 2. Run sudo poweroff in the VM. 3. Run shutdown now on the Proxmox Host.

Would you like me to draft the specific Raspberry Pi OOBM configuration script for your next session?
