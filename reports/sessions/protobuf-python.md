This report provides a consolidated, step-by-step guide to setting up, compiling, and running a Protocol Buffers (protobuf) project on a Chromebook.

---

## **Project Report: Protobuf Implementation in Python**

### **Prerequisites**

* **Chromebook:** Linux Development Environment enabled.
* **Editor:** VS Code installed via the Linux container.

---

### **Step 1: System Preparation**

Open your Terminal and install the necessary system tools and the protobuf compiler (`protoc`).

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install the Protobuf Compiler and Python Virtual Environment tool
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler python3-venv python3-pip -y

```

---

### **Step 2: Environment Setup**

To avoid the `externally-managed-environment` error, create an isolated space for your project.

```bash
# 1. Create a project directory and enter it
mkdir pb_project && cd pb_project

# 2. Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# 3. ACTIVATE the environment (Crucial step)
source venv/bin/activate

```

> **Note:** Your terminal should now show `(venv)` at the beginning of the prompt.

```bash
# 4. Install the protobuf library inside the virtual environment
pip install protobuf

```

---

### **Step 3: Define the Data Schema**

Create a file named `employee.proto` in your `pb_project` folder and paste the following schema:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

message Employee {
  int32 id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  string email = 3;

  enum Department {
    UNSPECIFIED = 0;
    ENGINEERING = 1;
    SALES = 2;
  }
  Department department = 4;

  repeated string skills = 5;

  message Address {
    string street = 1;
    string city = 2;
  }
  Address home_address = 6;
}

```

---

### **Step 4: Generate Python Code**

Use the compiler to turn your `.proto` file into a Python module.

```bash
protoc --python_out=. employee.proto

```

* **Result:** You will now see a file named `employee_pb2.py` in your folder. **Do not edit this file manually.**

---

### **Step 5: Write the Python Logic**

Create a file named `main.py` in the same folder. This script will populate the object, serialize it to binary, and then decode it back.

```python
import employee_pb2

# Create and fill the object
worker = employee_pb2.Employee()
worker.id = 101
worker.name = "Alice Quinn"
worker.email = "alice@company.com"
worker.department = employee_pb2.Employee.ENGINEERING
worker.skills.extend(["Python", "Linux"])
worker.home_address.street = "123 Chrome Way"
worker.home_address.city = "Mountain View"

# Serialize: Convert object to binary string
binary_data = worker.SerializeToString()

# Deserialize: Convert binary back into a new object
new_worker = employee_pb2.Employee()
new_worker.ParseFromString(binary_data)

# Print results
print(f"--- Protobuf Output ---")
print(f"Name: {new_worker.name}")
print(f"Binary Size: {len(binary_data)} bytes")
print(f"City: {new_worker.home_address.city}")

```

---

### **Step 6: Execution**

Run your script while the virtual environment is still active:

```bash
python3 main.py

```

---

### **Troubleshooting Checklist**

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| **`pip` error** | Ensure you ran `source venv/bin/activate`. |
| **`ImportError`** | Ensure `employee_pb2.py` exists in the same folder as `main.py`. |
| **`protoc` not found** | Run `sudo apt install protobuf-compiler`. |

Would you like me to show you how to automate this entire process using a **Makefile** so you can compile and run everything with a single command?
