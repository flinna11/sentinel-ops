Andy's Ubuntu Server Gem
Custom Gem
Acknowledged. The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server has been integrated into the "Sentinel" master blueprint. This addition transforms the cluster from a manually managed set of containers into an AI-orchestrated environment where your local LLMs can safely inspect and manage their own infrastructure.

Below is the updated Sentinel Status Report with the new index, configuration ID, and the detailed multi-phase roadmap.

📑 Sentinel: Multi-Phase Evolution Report
Configuration ID: SENTINEL-2026-0126-ZTA-MCP

Primary Anchor: 192.168.1.50 (Static)

Status: Recovered & Stabilized; Ready for Phase 1 Expansion

🗂️ Updated Index
Executive Summary: Transition from manual recovery to AI-driven Git-Ops.

Current Baseline: Hardware & software specifications post-IP re-anchoring.

Phase 1: Git-Ops & Resource Rectification: Establishing the "Source of Truth" and 24GB expansion.

Phase 2: Hardening & Vulnerability Scanning: OS security and CIS compliance auditing.

Phase 3: Out-of-Band Monitoring (OOBM): Raspberry Pi integration with Prometheus/Grafana.

Phase 4: MCP Integration (AI Control Plane): Connecting LLMs to cluster state via standardized protocol.

Phase 5: Secure AI & Messaging: Zero Trust deployment of Ollama and RabbitMQ.

Phase 6: Advanced Storage & Isolation: Longhorn USB RAID and Kata Container sandboxing.

🗺️ The Sentinel Master Roadmap (Phase 4 Integrated)
Phase	Milestone	Primary Goal	Key Tools
Phase 1	Git-Ops & RAM	Initialise Git tracking for /etc/rancher/rke2/ and verify 24GB allocation.	Git, qm set 100
Phase 2	Hardening	Execute OS/SSH hardening and run kube-bench for CIS compliance.	Kube-bench, Trivy
Phase 3	Monitoring	Set up Prometheus/Grafana on a Raspberry Pi for external observability.	Prometheus, Grafana
Phase 4	MCP Integration	(New) Deploy an MCP server to provide AI context for the RKE2 cluster.	kubernetes-mcp-server
Phase 5	AI & Messaging	Deploy Ollama (16GB limit) and RabbitMQ with Zero Trust mTLS.	Ollama, RabbitMQ
Phase 6	Storage/Isolation	Finalise security with Longhorn storage and Kata Containers.	Longhorn, Kata
🏗️ MCP Server: Bringing Intelligence to the Sentinel
The MCP server acts as a standardized "bridge" that allows an AI (like Ollama running locally or a remote agent) to safely interact with your cluster.

What Tools Does MCP Bring to Your System?
Cluster Inspection: AI can list all pods, check service statuses, and identify failing containers using natural language instead of complex kubectl commands.

Log & Event Triage: Tools that allow the AI to read pod logs and cluster events to diagnose issues automatically.

Diagnostic Reports: The ability for the AI to generate a "health report" of your RabbitMQ messaging bus or Ollama resource usage.

Safe Automation: By using a read-only MCP server, the AI can suggest fixes and draft YAML manifests without the risk of accidentally deleting your production database.

Demo: Sentinel AI Assistant
Once deployed, you will be able to perform a "Hello World" diagnostic check by asking:

"Sentinel AI, check if the Metrics Server is reporting data from the new 24GB RAM allocation and list any pods with high memory usage."

🚦 Next Steps for Your Return
Initialize Git: Commit current static IP and RKE2 configuration to your repository.

Verify Memory: Confirm the 24GB upgrade is active on the Proxmox host.

Deploy MCP: I can provide the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) manifest to securely connect a read-only MCP server to your cluster whenever you are ready.

The Roadmap and Report for Configuration SENTINEL-2026-0126-ZTA-MCP are now finalized. Ready for shutdown?
