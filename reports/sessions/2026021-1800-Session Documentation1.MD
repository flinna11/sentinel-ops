## 1. Executive Summary

The Sentinel-Ops project has successfully moved from a manual "Click-to-Deploy" model to a professional **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** workflow. We have stabilized the primary virtual machine (**VM-106**), implemented a secure credential management system using Terraform variables, and synchronized the project code with GitHub while maintaining high security standards through secret scrubbing and push protection.

---

## 2. Technical Achievements

### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

* **Targeted Deployment**: Successfully provisioned **VM-106** using Terraform, utilizing Template 105 as the base image.
* **Resource Tuning**: Specifically adjusted the VM footprint to **2GB RAM** to ensure host stability.
* **Guest Agent Integration**: Verified the **QEMU Guest Agent** status; this fixed the "102% RAM" display error by enabling accurate ballooning metrics between the VM and Proxmox.

### **Git & Repository Management**

* **VCS Synchronization**: Successfully pushed the project to a remote GitHub repository (`flinna11/sentinel-ops`).
* **Secret Scrubbing**: Performed an emergency `git commit --amend` to remove a Personal Access Token (PAT) accidentally stored in a documentation file.
* **CI/CD Foundation**: Authored and committed `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`, establishing the logic for automated planning.

### **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**

* **Secret Protection**: Implemented `secret.tfvars` and `.gitignore` to ensure local credentials never reach the cloud.
* **GitHub Vault**: Migrated Proxmox API Token ID and Secret to **GitHub Actions Secrets** for secure pipeline execution.
* **Token Scoping**: Updated the GitHub PAT with `workflow` scopes to allow the terminal to manage automated workflow files.

## 3. Current Environment Status

| Component | Specification | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Host System** | Proxmox VE 9 (16GB RAM) | **Healthy** |
| **Swap Space** | 7.8 GiB | **Active** |
| **Primary Workload** | VM-106 (Ubuntu) | **Running** |
| **Terraform Version** | v3.0.2-rc07 | **Stable** |
| **GitHub Actions** | Push Protection | **Enabled** |

---

## 4. Security & Risk Mitigation

* **Credential Leakage**: Mitigation achieved through the use of variables and Git ignore rules.
* **Host Stability**: Protected by a 7.8 GiB swap file and QEMU-driven memory reporting to prevent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crashes.
* **Workflow Integrity**: GitHub token scopes are now limited to necessary permissions only.

## 5. Roadmap: Automation & Scaling

### **Phase 2.1: The Secure Gateway**

Installation of a **GitHub Self-Hosted Runner** on the Ubuntu server. This allows GitHub to securely bypass the home firewall to talk to the Proxmox local IP (`192.168.1.104`).

### **Phase 2.2: Automated Approval**

Implementation of "Plan-on-PR," where Terraform shows the intended infrastructure changes in a GitHub comment before any code is merged to the main branch.

---

## 6. Action Items for Next Session

1. **Runner Setup**: Execute the `config.sh` and `run.sh` scripts provided by GitHub to link the local server to the cloud.
2. **Code Cleanup**: Add `skip_ipv6 = true` to the `main.tf` file to suppress persistent Guest Agent warnings.
3. **State Migration**: Investigate moving `terraform.tfstate` to a remote backend to prevent state loss during local hardware failure.

**Would you like me to help you start the Self-Hosted Runner installation now, or would you prefer I generate a video overview of this architecture using the Veo model?**
